95	medium	Do not go with the shape or pattern that are similar. The pattern changes all the time, the first few moves are crucial.	1	Always check the hint on the top when moving the arrows, it sometimes show your outcome for a second before the question mark.	1	Always check the hint on the top when moving the arrows, it sometimes show your outcome for a second before the question mark.	27
97	medium	The triangles combine only with the diamonds and vice versa. The squares combine only with the circles and vice versa. Following this, choose a figure to start with and start matching with its geometric partner that has a different color or pattern.  Example: I start with a square of stripes and combine it with a plain circle. Imagine that a plain square with different colour turns out, which I will combine with another circle with dots. And so on. When you can't combine more drop for later or collect depending on the moves you have left.	1	You can combine with colors or patterns that are different.

116	medium	Never go with two similar shaped crystals. combining different shapes might help to fuse. After you fuse it. Take it and harvest it in an empty space.	1	I didn't notice any pattern but I believe it never fuses when you try to combine two similar shaped crystals.	0	I didn't notice any pattern but I believe it never fuses when you try to combine two similar shaped crystals.	48
117	medium	Try and merge different shapes together to create high coloured shapes, once found 2 shapes that merge well together, keep merging with the same shape consistentely.	1	Circle + square helps get a higher colour circle.	0	Circle + square helps get a higher colour circle.	301000
118	medium	Can combine different colors together. Unsure of whether can fuse same shapes as I was unsuccessful. Checkered shapes can be combined with near full (checkered) shapes. The combined shape will combined properties, one of each shape (not color). Pressing spacebar will consume the item on an empty space, so make sure to press D to drop and not waste points!	1	Combined shapes retain properties of each items, the first item will be the shape, the pattern of the second. And colors do not have to be the same to be combined.	0	Combined shapes retain properties of each items, the first item will be the shape, the pattern of the second.

120	medium	I found that once I found a combination of shapes if I kept going for the same shape then the points would keep multiplying. I didn't notice any patterns between the different shadings of shapes only the actual shapes themselves. Once you get a purple gem don't forget to bank it as any other combinations won't increase value!	1	Triangle + Diamond (can keep stacking more diamonds) Square + Circle (again keep stacking circles) REMEMBER to pick up in the order stated (not sure what'll happen the opposite way) 	0	Triangle + Diamond (can keep stacking more diamonds) Square + Circle (again keep stacking circles) REMEMBER to pick up in the order stated (not sure what'll happen the opposite way) 	200213
