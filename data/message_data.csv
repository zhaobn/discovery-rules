14,0.1,easy,"to fuse the crystals, just start by picking up a random one. If you pick up a triangle, fuse it with another triangle and so on. If you pick up a square, fuse it with another square and so on. This applies to all the shapes. Just fuse it with the same shape that you are carrying.",4000

24,0.1,medium,Nothing seems to merge with the Squares. Don't waste your time on this,3
25,0.1,medium,Merge two solids with each other - a solid red triangle and a solid red circle will give you an orange triangle. Solid red square and solid red rhombus will give you an orange square. Orange square and striped rhombus will give you a green square. The orange triangle and checkered rhombus will give you a green triangle. Green two figures will give you nothing - don't do it.

27,0.1,medium,"Do not just randomly choose the crystal on the map , have a pattern and combination of shapes. ",16
28,0.1,easy,"It seems you can fuse items of the same shape, the pattern is not important. For example a circle can fuse with another circle of any pattern, but a circle can never fuse with a square, even if the pattern is the same.

29,0.1,hard,"Circles don't combine from what I have learned. I have successfully combined squares (diagonal lines + solid red = solid orange).
You can make a dotted orange circle by combining doted red circle and doted red square. That combines with solid triange to make solid yellow circle. That combined with doted red triange makes doted green circle (which is worth 1000 points).
Other combinations I discovered:
solid red circle + solid red rhombus = solid orange circle
any combination of dots + grid (multiple lines intersecting) that I tried, did not work

39,0.1,medium,No successfull conbinations found. Matching patterns and matching shapes did not produce successfull fusions (not all combinations were attempted). Trying to match shapes with nothing in common also did not produce successfull fusions. Successfull matching might be based on initial position of the cristals. Good luck!,5

44,0.1,medium,"I will refer to the rotated square/diamond shape as a ""rhombus.""

I was able to determine that combining a solid red shape (without a pattern) with a different red shape featuring dots resulted in an orange shape with the dot pattern.

Combinations that worked:

    - Solid red circle + dotted red rhombus = dotted orange circle
    - Solid red square + dotted red circle = dotted orange square
    - Solid red rhombus + dotted red square = dotted orange rhombus

Combinations that did not work:

    - Striped rhombus + dotted square

    - Dotted triangle + checkered square
    - Dotted triangle + checkered circle

I would also recommend trying to combine the different shapes between each other once you get the green crystals, instead of directly harvesting them. I did not test it and I think that could help you maximize your points even more.",4000

80,0.2,easy,its very easy to pick up and drop items into bag . fusing the shaoes (shapes) is  a bit more difficult i used the best stragety i sy 9(strategy) i could think if of and it was to comnbine the shapes that are similar and that resluted in fusing of shapes for more points.,40
81,0.2,hard,"I got two combinations to work, but I don't know why. 
First the square with the vertical and horizontal lines with the rotated solid square. Then add the square with the square with lots of dots then the solid red square to get 1000 points.
