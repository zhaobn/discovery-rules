13,hard,Take your time and try to think before playing the game. Just because you are getting a hint it does not mean you will get a crystal.,WIth a cycle and a solid colur square you can get a crystal. It is always 2 different shapes that get you a crystal.,0

34,hard,Find successful crystal combinations and then drop them. Pair the dropped combinations to create more combinations.,Combinations always take on the shape of the first crystal. Combinations always take on the texture of the second crystal.,111

36,hard,I really don't understand this game. I thought I was playing it right but I didn't do very well. Tip: start with the closest gem and move outwards. Make lots of variations.,that I was not doing it right! Shapes that are the same don't seem to combine well.,26

45,hard,I tried to combine the crystals in accordance to the matching patterns.  ,They are best combined when they look alike.,1018
46,hard,A square with a pattern in and a solid red circle gave me more points,Diamond circle and square circle seemed to give me more points,175
47,easy,Gems of the same shape merge to make new gems.  Colour and pattern doesn't seem to matter.,Merging gems of the same shape produced new gems.  Attempting to merge gems of differing shapes failed every time in my trials.,400031

55,medium-1,be attentive and focused. don't look for identical figures with identical patterns.,items must have the same pattern,7
56,hard,Be methodical in trying the combinations.,Check the hint box as it shows what you have tried previously.  None of the shapes shown combine with a green crystal to make another colour.,0

60,hard,be patient and do not cash in any item before finding patters.,"circles and squares need to have the same pattern. rhombus and triangles have to not have the same pattern or dotted pattern with lines.

76,easy,"dear future player
when you pick your crystals make sure they are of the same shape even if its different colors, you will be given different shapes to choose from. the first shape you choose stick to it, good luck.","the rule was crystals come in many shapes, forms and colors, let go of crystals ones you done picking to allow for space to pick up more, combining same shape different colors is best because some colors have more points than others.",10

82,hard,Dont forget to harvest when you feel like its the right time.,Circles and squares are usually the two to fuse together.Patterns are also a hint sometimes. Diamond and Triangles fuse.,112
83,medium-1,"Look for patterns, for me it was circle + square of different inner lines made new circles, square + circle of different inner patterns made new squares. The shape you hold determined (was the same) as the new shape it forms and the pattern you fuse onto (the second shape) determines the inner pattern of the new shape. The other shapes were completely useless to me and I could not create recipes from them.  ",Only circles with squares could make new shapes. With the shape being determined by what you are holding (either a circle or square) and the inner pattern being determined by the shape you are not holding.,1001
84,easy,Don't rush during the game and take time to see how the recipes form to make the best judgement. Observe how the shapes merge.,You can only combine similarly shaped crystals. a circular crystal will only combine with another circular crystal,111
85,easy,"Combine the same shapes and collect all the same shapes until they are finished. Don't rush to drop a shape because new ones of the same type may pop up. When finished with a certain set of shapes, be sure to drop the one you are holding, then pick up another one and repeat the same pattern. Never mix two different shapes.","When you mix different shapes, you get an error, but mixing the same shape can give you a new shape and color and therefore points, depending on the patterns on the shapes that you mixed.",111143
86,easy,"When selecting, select the same shape. For instance if you are are going for circle, you combine all circle. To select a shape press the space bar key on your keyboard. To move around use the arrow keys ie the up, down, left and right keys on your keyboard. If you want to drop the shape you are holding, you press the D key on your keyboard"," Now for the pattern a plan red circle  ie without any pattern and a square patterned orange circle will give a plan yellow circle
A plan red diamond shape combined with a square red diamond will give an orange squared patterned diamond, an orange  patterned diamond with a red dotted diamond will give a yellow dotted diamond. A yellow dotted diamond with a slight lined patterned  red diamond will give a blue slight lined patterned diamond shape. In essence just play around and combine the same shapes together
