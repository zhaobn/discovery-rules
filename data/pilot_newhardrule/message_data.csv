10,test,Try combining solid shapes with shapes with dots on. Also try square patterned shapes with diagonal patterned shapes. ,"Solid shapes combine with dotty shapes. 
Square patterned shapes combine with diagonal patterned shapes. ",221
11,test,JUST PAY ATTENTION TO MOVES YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY DONE ITS HARD TO WRTIE A GUIDE ,DIDNT NOTICE ,100013
12,test,"Shapes that contain stripes seem to be able to be paired with shapes that contain squares. Try holding on to the combined shape. If it contains stripes, pick up a different shape that contains squares and vice-versa until this stops working.","Shapes containing stripes paired with different shapes containing squares. Whichever pattern within the shape was picked up last, would be the pattern taken on by the new combined crystal.",0
13,test,"Square and triangle make orange, that's as far as I got. ","Sorry, not sure",34
14,test,keep dumping no winners,spots and squarers are good,135
15,test,Once you have created the next stage in triangles keep merging with the red triangles that will keep creating the next stages,I found it very random so just kept trying different combinations,35
16,test,Look at the combinations of the different sha`pes and patterns and just try different combinations,I didnt notice any pattern ,200011
17,test,If you find a combination that works try to recreate this combination (eg. full red circle + red dotted square = orange dotted circle) ,I did not notice any rules or patterns ,1000
18,test,Just try your best,Circle and triangle increases value,22
20,hard-1,Don't stick with the same symbol after it has combined keep trying different recipes,I did not notice any rules or patterns,10001
21,hard-1,Squares + Circles seem to fuse well using different patterns also triangle an diamonds,Squares + Circles seem to fuse well using different patterns also triangle an diamonds,1320
22,hard-1,"Good luck, make sure though you replace the original crytsal held when you get the next one and so on","None noticed, seemed very random",0
23,hard-1,I'm afraid I don't have any tips or strategies as I scored 0 points!,I didn't notice any rules or patterns at all.,10
24,hard-1,I did not observe any rules unfortunately - remember that you are carrying one crystal at all times and make sure you make your final move outside a crystal field - I lost all my points from violet crystal as I was not paying attention.,I suspect pointy shapes with same pattern may be a good starting point. Keep trying!,110
25,hard-1,combine triangles and tilted squares,the second shape's pattern will be in the new shape you create,100000
26,hard-1,Remember to drop crystals,Diagonal stripes seemed to fuse well,100028
27,hard-1,Merging a square with a circle seemed to be key.,Merging a square with a circle of a contrasting pattern.,110000
28,hard-1,red circles and squares will give you an orange. good luck,i couldnt see any patterns as i felt under pressure to finish the game . with hindsight i realise i could have just taken my time. it looks like red circles and square produce a orange,73
29,hard-1,good luck,checked red triangle and solid red diamond makes orange triangle...orange triangle and checked diamond makes lime triangle....checked red diamond and orange triangle makes lime diamond.....dotted red triangle and striped red diamond makes striped orange triangle....combine this with lime diamond gets green triangle,1141
