        <b>Who are the researchers?</b>
        <p>Principal Investigator: Dr. Bonan Zhao.</p>

        <b>What is the purpose of the study?</b> 
        <p>This research investigates how people identify patterns, infer hidden rules, 
          and communicate their reasoning in interactive environments.
        </p>

        <b>Do I have to take part?</b>
        <p>No - participation in this study is entirely up to you. 
          You can withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason. 
          Your rights will not be affected. If you wish to withdraw, contact the PI. 
          We will stop using your data in any publications or presentations submitted after you have withdrawn consent. 
          However, we will keep copies of your original consent, and of your withdrawal request.
        </p>

        <b>What will happen if I decide to take part? </b>
        <p>If you decide to participate, you will be asked to complete a series of tasks related to 
          decision-making, pattern identification, and reasoning. 
          You will provide responses to questions regarding your judgments on patterns, 
          probabilities, and causal relationships. 
          Data will be collected through interactive online tasks, including written responses to prompts. 
          <span>The session will last approximately 10 minutes.</span>
        </p>

        <p>Your participation will not involve any audio or video recording. 
          The study will be conducted entirely online, and you can complete it at a time that is convenient for you.
        </p>

        <b>Compensation. </b>
        <p>You will be paid &#163;1.50 for your participation in this study.</p>


        <b>Are there any risks associated with taking part?</b>
        <p>There are no significant risks associated with participation. </p>

        <b>Are there any benefits associated with taking part?</b>
        <p>While there are no direct benefits beyond compensation for your participation, 
          this research aims to enhance our understanding of human cognition, 
          which could contribute to the development of automated systems capable of solving complex problems 
          that humans can easily address with minimal guidance.
        </p>

        <b>What will happen to the results of this study? </b>
        <p>The results of this study may be summarised in published articles, reports and presentations.

          Your data will be referred to by a unique participant number rather than by name.

        </p>
        <p>All electronic data will be stored on a password-protected encrypted computer,
