1. **Prioritize Combinations**: Combing objects often yields new items that can be consumed for higher points. Focus on combining pairs that you have identified as successful in previous rounds.

2. **Maintain a Balanced Inventory**: Keep a mix of objects ready for potential combinations. Having both simple shapes (like squares and circles) and their variations increases your chances of successful combinations.

3. **Learn from Failures**: If a combination fails, observe which items were used and avoid combining them in the same way again. Instead, consider alternative combinations.

4. **Consume Wisely**: Before consuming low-point items (1 point), evaluate if keeping them might lead to a better combination later. Aim to consume higher-point items as much as possible.

5. **Explore All Options**: Don't hesitate to try combining lesser-used objects. Some combinations that seem unlikely could yield useful results.

Here are some strategies to maximize your points in the grid-world game:

1. **Combining for Higher Values**: Focus on combining objects that yield new types rather than consuming them immediately. The combined items often provide more points when consumed (like the yellow shapes), so look for effective combinations first.

2. **Prioritize Combos with High Point Yields**: Items that resulted in more points when consumed should be prioritized. For example, yellow shapes gave 10 points each, which is significantly better than 1 point from regular items.

3. **Experiment with Combinations**: Even if you fail to combine some items, keep experimenting with different pairs. You might discover new combos that lead to valuable items.

4. **Consume Wisely**: Be strategic about which items to consume. If they only offer 1 point, consider holding onto them in case they can be combined later.

5. **Track Failed Combinations**: If a particular combination fails multiple times, it may not be worth pursuing further. Focus on alternative items.

By following these patterns and strategies, you can optimize your gameplay and maximize your points. Good luck!"
