simple,0,0,0,Rule: Combining objects of the same color value results in the creation of a higher object value.
simple,0,0,5,Rule: Objects can only be combined if they belong to the same color category or have a specific complementary combination.
simple,0,0,10,Rule: Combinations are invalid if both objects do not share at least one common attribute.
simple,0,0,15,Rule: Combinations of objects with colors that are too far apart in value do not create a new object.
simple,0,0,20,"Rule: Combinations involving color values that differ significantly (e.g., red with purple) result in failure, suggesting only similar value ranges may combine successfully."
simple,0,0,25,"Rule: Only objects of a certain color can successfully combine, possibly requiring a specific combination of object colors to create a new valid object."
simple,0,0,30,Rule: Objects with the same color value cannot be combined.
simple,0,0,35,Rule: Combinations may only be successful if the objects share a common property or belong to the same color category.
simple,0,0,41,"Rule: Two items can be combined if they have compatible types or properties, resulting in a new item, but specific combinations lead to failures."
