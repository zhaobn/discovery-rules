0,"**Hypothesis:** Valid combinations of objects are based on the additive properties of color values, where two objects can combine if the sum of their color values is equal to the color value of an object in the current ranking. For instance, combining red (1) and yellow (10) can create orange (100) if the observed pattern holds true for higher-level combinations. 

To test this hypothesis, one should try various combinations of colors that sum to known values within the hierarchy (e.g., combining two different colors that together equal a higher singular color's value to see if a valid combination is formed). Additionally, testing combinations that do not follow this additive rule should help confirm whether the sum-based combining pattern is accurate."
