simple,0,0,0,Rule: Shapes of the same type can only combine if they have the same texture.
simple,0,0,5,"Rule: Combinations can only be made between objects of the same color and shape, with at least one having a different texture."
simple,0,0,10,Rule: Only objects of the same color and shape can be combined if their textures are either the same or compatible based on hidden interactions.
simple,0,0,15,Rule: Objects can be combined if they share the same shape and texture type.
simple,0,0,20,Rule: Combinations are successful if both objects share the same shape and have compatible textures.
simple,0,0,25,"Rule: Objects can be combined if they share the same color and have compatible shapes and textures (e.g., triangles can combine with triangles, and diamonds with diamonds), but only if their textures are the same or of different types within a shape category."
simple,0,0,30,"Rule: Combinations are valid when objects share the same color and shape, regardless of texture."
simple,0,0,35,"Rule: Combinations can only be made between objects of the same color and shape, with the same or complementary texture patterns."
simple,0,0,41,"Rule: Combinations succeed primarily between shapes of the same type (e.g., triangles, circles, diamonds) with distinct patterns or colors."
