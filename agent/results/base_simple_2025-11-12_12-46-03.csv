41,message_to_next_player,0,48,"{'message': ""**Advice for Success in the Grid-World Game:**\n\n1. **Focus on Combinations:** Combining objects can yield significantly more points. For example, the yellow square striped earned you 10 points, while many consumed individual objects only grant 1 point. Identify items to combine early on.\n\n2. **Prioritize Color and Shape:** It's beneficial to understand which shapes and colors have more potential for combination. Experimenting with different combinations can sometimes unleash higher-value objects.\n\n3. **Keep Track of your Inventory:** Make a note of the objects you've consumed versus those that are still available for combination. This will help leverage opportunities to create new, higher-point items.\n\n4. **Be Strategic with Consumption:** While consuming various items is necessary, focus on maximizing points by combining first whenever possible. Plan your steps to avoid consuming items that can be combined.\n\n5. **Explore Patterns:** Certain items can lead to predictable outcomes when combined. Observing these patterns will help you optimize your strategy for future plays.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you can enhance your gameplay and maximize your points!""}"
