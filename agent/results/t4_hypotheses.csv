simple,0,0,0,Rule: Combinations are valid when the shapes of two objects are the same and their textures differ.
simple,0,0,5,Rule: Combinations can only be made if the shapes are the same and the textures are different.
simple,0,0,10,"Rule: Combinations can only occur between objects of the same shape but require different textures (e.g., plain with dotted) for valid pairs."
simple,0,0,15,Rule: Combinations are valid when the shapes are the same and the textures are either the same or different.
simple,0,0,20,Rule: Objects can only be combined if they share the same shape and texture type.
simple,0,0,25,Rule: Combinations can only occur between objects of the same shape and where at least one object has a different texture.
simple,0,0,30,"Rule: Objects can only combine if they share the same shape and their textures are either both plain or both patterned (striped, dotted, or checkered)."
simple,0,0,35,Rule: Combinations are only valid if the shapes are the same and the textures are different.
simple,0,0,41,"Rule: Color and pattern combination of compatible shapes often results in a new shape of a different color and pattern, while incompatible combinations or those with similar types result in failure."
