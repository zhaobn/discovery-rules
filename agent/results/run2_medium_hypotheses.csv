0,"**Hypothesis on Object Combinations:**

Valid combinations appear to be based on the color value hierarchy and multiplicative relationships. Specifically:

1. **Hierarchy-Based Combination**: Objects can combine only if the color value of one object is exactly ten times that of the other. For example, combining a yellow object (10) with a red object (1) is valid, as 10 is ten times 1.

2. **Additive Validity at Higher Tiers**: Combinations are valid if one of the objects is exactly one order of magnitude higher than the other. For example, combining orange (100) with yellow (10) would be valid, as 100 is ten times 10.

3. **No Combinations with Dissimilar Colors**: Combinations between dissimilar color categories (for example, red with blue, or yellow with green) are invalid, reinforcing a structure where combinations only occur within the same color family or tiered relationships.

This hypothesis can be tested by systematically applying different combinations of objects, tracking successful and failed combos, and verifying against the proposed rules. If confirmed, this could guide optimal strategies for maximizing points using the limited actions available."
