simple,0,0,0,"Rule: Combinations may only occur between objects of the same shape or texture, resulting in a new object of higher value based on their combined colors."
simple,0,0,5,Rule: Combinations of objects are valid only if they share either the same shape or the same texture.
simple,0,0,10,Rule: Combinations are only valid if the shapes are the same and the textures are either the same or match the pattern of alternating textures.
simple,0,0,15,"Rule: Combinations are valid if the objects have the same color and shape, regardless of texture."
simple,0,0,20,Rule: Combinations must consist of objects that share either the same shape or the same texture.
simple,0,0,25,Rule: Combinations of the same color and shape are valid if their textures are different.
simple,0,0,30,Rule: Combinations are valid if they share the same shape and one of the textures is dotted or checkered.
simple,0,0,35,"Rule: Objects of the same color and shape can be combined if they have compatible textures (plain with dotted, checkered with striped, etc.)."
simple,0,0,41,"Rule: Combinations fail if the items have incompatible types or attributes, while successful combinations result in a new item of a different type."
